<p>As you can see, my personal website is online! I used the hugo academics theme and created the website with the great R package blogdown. It works really great and makes the creation of a website easy. As starting point, I followed the instructions of the blogdown book by Yihui Xie which is <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">available for download</a></p>
